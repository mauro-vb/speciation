# Speciation

A simple animal customizer app made in Godot 4 where you can mix and match heads, torsos, and legs. The idea originated from a creative assignment for an evolution class taken during undergraduate studies. All art and the original concept are by [@trebuchet_girlz](https://twitter.com/trebuchet_girlz).
